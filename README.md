A module to integrate Google Maps ([Angular Google Maps](https://github.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps)) and d3.js are included (d3.js library is integrated as a service following [D3 on AngularJS article](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/d3-on-angular.html)).

[Oboe.js](http://oboejs.com/) is used to handle streaming JSON resources.
